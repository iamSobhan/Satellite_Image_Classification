The Indian Pines dataset is a Hyperspectral dataset that is commonly utilized in the processing of hyperspectral images. 
It was acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor over an agricultural area in Indiana, USA. 
224 spectral bands are contained inside the dataset's 145 rows and 145 columns. Each pixel in the dataset represents a 20x20 meter area on the ground. T
he Indian Pines dataset contains 16 different classes of land cover, including agricultural fields, forests, and urban areas. 
The classes and their corresponding number of samples in the dataset are Alfalfa: 46 samples, Corn-notill: 1428 samples, Corn-mintill: 830 samples, Corn: 237 samples, Grass-pasture: 483 samples, Grass-trees: 730 samples, Grass-pasture-mowed: 28 samples, Hay-windrowed: 478 samples, Oats: 20 samples, Soybean-notill: 972 samples, Soybean-mintill: 2455 samples, Soybean-clean: 593 samples, Wheat: 205 samples, Woods: 1265 samples, Buildings-Grass-Trees-Drives: 386 samples and Stone-Steel-Towers: 93 samples. 
A vector of 224 spectral values is used to represent each sample in the collection. 
The dataset also includes ground truth maps that indicate the true class labels for each pixel in the image.
