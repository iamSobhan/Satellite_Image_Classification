# Satellite_Image_Classification
## Introduction
#### Satellite picture Categorization is a challenging area of remote sensing picture interpretation. Its goal is to accurately label each and every pixel in the image by two sections with various object semantic ground identification[1]. In many areas of Agriculture, Environmental monitoring, and Crop Monitoring, Urban planning, Disaster management, and Management Infrastructures Development, Studies of Climate Changes, Geological and Geographical Analysis, Wildlife Conservation, Biodiversity Monitoring, Energy and Natural Resource Management Satellite Image Classification is essential. Although object recognition and categorization of images have been extensively explored, it is more difficult to detect objects in satellite photos due to their tiny size and the difficulty in tracking and capturing their visual characteristics. To this purpose, numerous automated methods for detection and categorization, various methods have been presented and are currently being developed. for identifying and classifying objects in satellite photos, numerous algorithms have been put forth, ranging from traditional Machine Learning to modern Deep Learning. Deep learning has become a potent new method for classifying satellite images.[8] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a particular kind of Deep Learning model, may learn to extract features from satellite images that are important for the categorization and classification of satellite pictures. Consequently, the classification accuracy of satellite images has significantly improved. In this report, I propose an evaluation of Deep Learning and Machine Learning approaches to Satellite Image Classification. Utilizing the Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Salinas datasets, three openly available datasets, I demonstrate the ability of Deep Learning models to reach cutting-edge accuracy. I also provide examples of that compared to Machine Learning models, Models for Deep Learning are more resistant to noise and fluctuations in light. Comparing and evaluating the performance of the three datasetâ€™s Deep Learning and Machine Learning methods, for instance, CNN, SVM, and Random Forest, this report shows that Deep Learning is a potent method for classifying satellite images.
