## Introduction
#### <p>Satellite picture Categorization is a challenging area of remote sensing picture interpretation. Its goal is to accurately label each and every pixel in the image by two sections with various object semantic ground identification. In many areas of Agriculture, Environmental monitoring, and Crop Monitoring, Urban planning, Disaster management, and Management Infrastructures Development, Studies of Climate Changes, Geological and Geographical Analysis, Wildlife Conservation, Biodiversity Monitoring, Energy and Natural Resource Management Satellite Image Classification is essential. Although object recognition and categorization of images have been extensively explored, it is more difficult to detect objects in satellite photos due to their tiny size and the difficulty in tracking and capturing their visual characteristics. To this purpose, numerous automated methods for detection and categorization, various methods have been presented and are currently being developed. for identifying and classifying objects in satellite photos, numerous algorithms have been put forth, ranging from traditional Machine Learning to modern Deep Learning. Deep learning has become a potent new method for classifying satellite images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a particular kind of Deep Learning model, may learn to extract features from satellite images that are important for the categorization and classification of satellite pictures. Consequently, the classification accuracy of satellite images has significantly improved. In this report, I propose an evaluation of Deep Learning and Machine Learning approaches to Satellite Image Classification. Utilizing the Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Salinas datasets, three openly available datasets, I demonstrate the ability of Deep Learning models to reach cutting-edge accuracy. I also provide examples of that compared to Machine Learning models, Models for Deep Learning are more resistant to noise and fluctuations in light. Comparing and evaluating the performance of the three datasetâ€™s Deep Learning and Machine Learning methods, for instance, CNN, SVM, and Random Forest, this report shows that Deep Learning is a potent method for classifying satellite images.</>p
## Satellite Image Classification: An Overview
### The technique of recognizing and categorizing objects or different types of land cover in satellite photographs is known as satellite image classification. Due to the complexity of satellite images, which can be impacted by elements like lighting, atmospheric conditions, and sensor noise, this is a difficult task. Traditional approaches to satellite image categorization, like those relying on manually drawn features, have had difficulty achieving high accuracy. 
In satellite image classification, acquiring the satellite images is the initial stage in the classification. Several sources, including private satellites, governmental satellites, government or Private websites, and drones, can be used to collect the datasets. Large-Scale visual recognition challenge for ImageNet identifying and classification of items in pictures has been dominated by CNN-based algorithms. The main technology giants, including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, have already implemented CNN-based goods and services as a result of this success, which has revolutionized picture understanding. The images must be pre-processed after they are acquired. This entails actions like noise removal, adjusting for atmospheric effects, and resizing the images. The next is the extraction of features from the image in the following stage. Many techniques, including hand-crafted features and deep learning features, are being utilized to extract these properties. Highlights that have been manually created by humans are those that are pertinent for classification. Deep learning characteristics are those that a machine learning model has learned from the data. Once the features are extracted, they need to be classified. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Evaluation of the categorization outcomes is the last step.[9] A number of criteria, including recall, accuracy, and precision, can be used to do this. The percentage of all samples that are correctly identified is known as accuracy. The proportion of samples that are accurately categorized as positive is known as precision. The proportion of positive samples that are correctly categorized is known as recall. Additionally, the creation of more precise and scalable categorization algorithms has been aided by the accessibility of high-resolution satellite images, open-source datasets, and cloud computing resources. The accuracy and capability of satellite image classification have further improved with the integration of additional remote sensing data sources, such as LiDAR or radar data, and the utilization of multi-temporal and multi-sensor imaging.
