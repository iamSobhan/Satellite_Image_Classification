## Satellite Image Classification: An Overview
#### <p align="justify">The technique of recognizing and categorizing objects or different types of land cover in satellite photographs is known as satellite image classification. Due to the complexity of satellite images, which can be impacted by elements like lighting, atmospheric conditions, and sensor noise, this is a difficult task. Traditional approaches to satellite image categorization, like those relying on manually drawn features, have had difficulty achieving high accuracy. In satellite image classification, acquiring the satellite images is the initial stage in the classification. Several sources, including private satellites, governmental satellites, government or Private websites, and drones, can be used to collect the datasets. Large-Scale visual recognition challenge for ImageNet identifying and classification of items in pictures has been dominated by CNN-based algorithms. The main technology giants, including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, have already implemented CNN-based goods and services as a result of this success, which has revolutionized picture understanding. The images must be pre-processed after they are acquired. This entails actions like noise removal, adjusting for atmospheric effects, and resizing the images. The next is the extraction of features from the image in the following stage. Many techniques, including hand-crafted features and deep learning features, are being utilized to extract these properties. Highlights that have been manually created by humans are those that are pertinent for classification. Deep learning characteristics are those that a machine learning model has learned from the data. Once the features are extracted, they need to be classified. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Evaluation of the categorization outcomes is the last step.[9] A number of criteria, including recall, accuracy, and precision, can be used to do this. The percentage of all samples that are correctly identified is known as accuracy. The proportion of samples that are accurately categorized as positive is known as precision. The proportion of positive samples that are correctly categorized is known as recall. Additionally, the creation of more precise and scalable categorization algorithms has been aided by the accessibility of high-resolution satellite images, open-source datasets, and cloud computing resources. The accuracy and capability of satellite image classification have further improved with the integration of additional remote sensing data sources, such as LiDAR or radar data, and the utilization of multi-temporal and multi-sensor imaging.</p>
## Deep Learning for Satellite Image Classification
#### <p align="justify">A key issue in the computer vision and machine learning, deep learning domain is image classification, which is labeling or categorizing images based on their visual information. Convolutional neural networks, in particular, have become effective tools for classifying satellite images using deep learning approaches. By delivering cutting-edge performance on multiple datasets, it has completely changed image categorization. The most popular neural network design for image categorization is convolutional neural networks. the CNNs designed to instantly recognize and extrapolate hierarchical properties from images. They are made up of several layers, including pooling, convolutional, and fully connected layers. Filters are applied using convolutional layers to the input images to identify regional spatial patterns. By combining layers, the spatial dimensions are reduced and the most important features are extracted. Based on the learned attributes, fully connected layers carry out the final categorization. RNNs can identify images that have been gathered over time because they can learn the temporal relationships in images. FCNNs are a more general type of neural network that is usable for a range of purposes, including image classification. Neural networks are able to learn complex relationships between the pixels in an image and the class of the image. It can achieve high classification accuracies.</p>
