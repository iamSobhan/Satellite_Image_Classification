The Pavia University scene is a hyperspectral dataset collected by the ROSIS, short for Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer sensor over an agricultural area in Pavia, Italy. It is commonly used to categorize land cover and remote sensing research. The dataset consists of 610 rows and 340 columns, with 103 spectral bands altogether. Each pixel in the dataset represents a 1.3x1.3-meter area on the ground. The Pavia University scene dataset contains nine different classes of land cover, including various types of crops, bare soil, and meadows. The classes and their corresponding number of samples in the dataset are Asphalt: 6631 samples, Meadow: 18649 samples, Gravel: 2099 samples, Trees: 3064 samples, Metal sheets: 1345 samples, Bare soil: 5029 samples, Bitumen: 1330 samples, Bricks: 3682 samples, Shadows: 947 samples. The dataset's samples are each represented by a vector of 103 spectral values. The dataset also includes ground truth maps that indicate the true class labels for each pixel in the image.
